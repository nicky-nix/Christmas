			<div class="first-text">
				It's finally that time of the year my love, its the Christmas special of
				my 16th chapter and 12th Season 12 of my life. Its the season of giving,
				sharing and loving also, cause' sharing is caring and caring is loving
				hehe. It is also around this time that these kind of things started, us
				giving each other letters, gifts and not just that but also us making
				efforts for each other which made me feel very special:>.
			</div>
			<div class="second-text">
				I can still remember how that day went and I know you do too, you
				probably didn't know what happened before that day and let me be honest
				to you, I didn't plan any of that, giving you that letter was not part
				of the plan but I still gave you that letter, how? On the day of our
				Christmas party, December 15 2023,it was Friday, yes, I checked my
				diary, I woke up extra early didn't know why but all I know is that
				something made me write that letter and so I made one and why did I do
				that? Is it because of love? gratitude? Both maybe? Well, what do you
				think?
			</div>
			<div class="third-text">
				I'm currently reading my 15/12/23 entry and right now and it feels so
				nostalgic, remembering this day, it's feel so nice and innocent. I
				actually wrote your reaction when I gave you the letter and you said
				"All my life I-" yes that was it you didn't finish it. You sound so cute
				and innocent my love.
			</div>
			<div class="fourth-text">
				So, love let me thank you with all of these memories that I carry today
				through this letter? dunno if its a letter, I'm planning actually on
				making things more unique this time and I hope you'll like it.
			</div>
			<div class="fifth-text">
				This time my love, I wish for a healthy health not just for me but to
				everyone I know, a happy life with you as someone more than what we are
				now, and a year full of opportunities for me to grow as the person who I
				wanted to be.
			</div>
			<div class="sixth-text">
				Before I finish, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you my love. Next
				Year I hope that this doesn't end and "it will be ours, next time"
			</div>
			<div class="seventh-text">
				"From the bottom of my heart, Thank you and I love You, I always do."
			</div>
			<div class="eight-text">Always and will only remain yours. Dominic</div>
